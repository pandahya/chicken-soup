        "description":"I'm sorta sick of miso soup now but here's how you can make it with the least amount of dishes (if you take the lazy route, it's one bowl and 3 kitchen utensils). If you must, you can omit all the solid ingredients and literally just make the liquid part but then you can't call it a meal.",

            "Miso paste (it’s easier to buy the one with Dashi stock already added)",
            "Soft Tofu (Level 2 for the House Foods brand)",

            "Hot Water (either from a kettle or a microwave)"],
        "instructions":[
            "Cut the Tofu into 1cm cubes. (Note: you can do this on your hand instead of on a cutting board. TBH, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone cut tofu on a cutting board. Hand is the way to go.)",
            "Put the tofu in a heatsafe bowl",
            "Save the rest of the tofu by putting it in a container and filling it with cold water until the tofu is completely submerged. It’s a pain in the ass if you’re not gonna finish all the tofu in one go bc you have to change the water every day. The tofu is gonna be good for at MOST a week. I wouldn’t push it any more than that….5 days is probably a lot really...try to eat it all in 3 days or less.)",
            "Add water to the bowl (This can be already hot water, or you can add the water to the bowl and pop it in the microwave for maybe 2-3 minutes.)", 
            "Optional: If you aren’t lazy and want to rehydrate seaweed, then do that now. Put some seaweed in a separate bowl (yeah sorry this is another bowl ur gonna have to wash.) The seaweed has to be the Wakame type bc idk that’s just how it is. It won’t seem like a lot, but once you add water, you’ll realize you added too much seaweed and you’ll be making seaweed salad instead of miso soup….so don’t add too much. Add hot water. Soak for maybe 5 minutes?? (i never do the seaweed so idk anymore oops)",
            "Scoop out some miso paste and dissolve it into the hot water (with chopsticks or whatever else you have). So I actually don’t know how much you need. It depends on the miso paste you’re using and how strong you like your soup. I used a little more than half a spoonful but that might be too much for one bowl….but I was trying to finish all the miso paste anyways so whatever. You can adjust the taste by either adding more miso or adding more water.",
            "(If you made the seaweed, add that to the soup now. Make sure you don’t add the seaweed water bc that’s saltey)",
